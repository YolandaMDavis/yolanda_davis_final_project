## Overview

Your final project is an opportunity to approach a problem from a data science perspective. You will be required to use all of your skills from class in order to demonstrate your ability to apply data science concepts to a real world problem.


#### Pro Tips:
- Your problem does not necessarily need to be financially motivated in order to be be insightful. 
- Your goal should be to prove that you can use your new skills in a deliberate, thoughtful manner.
- You may wish to share this project with others, so try to:
    - Comment all of your code (this assists with reproducibility)
    - Provide clear reasons and rationale for each decision

## Project Structure
The workflow for our final project is divided up into multiple parts:

1. Part 1: Define a problem statement
2. Part 2: Identify data sources
3. Part 3: Clean and analyze your data
4. Part 4: Build a model
5. Part 5: Write up and present your findings
6. *Optional*: Deploy, as desired

## Deliverables

By the end of this project, you will have produced three key deliverables:

- A clean and well-commented Jupyter notebook documenting your model for a technical audience.
- A written summary (or blog post) that explains your project for a non-technical audience.
- A presentation that describes your process for a general audience of both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
