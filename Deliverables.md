## Overview

Your final project is an opportunity to approach a problem from a data science perspective. You will be required to use all of your newfound skills in order to demonstrate how to use data science to approach a real world problem. 

#### Pro Tips:
- Your problem does not necessarily need to be financially motivated in order to be be insightful. 
- Your goal should be to prove that you can use your new skills in a deliberate, thoughtful manner.
- You may wish to share this project with others, so make sure to articulate your logic by:
    - Commenting on all of your code (this assists with reproducibility).
    - Providing clear reasons and rationale for each of your decisions.
    - Frame your specific analysis, stating any risks, limitations, or areas that you were unable to get to.

## Project Structure
The workflow for our final project is divided up into multiple parts:

1. **Part 1:** Test and validate 2-3 initial ideas
2. **Part 2:** Select data and outline specific goals
3. **Part 3:** Clean and analyze your data
4. **Part 4:** Build and document a working model
5. **Part 5:** Summarize and present your findings
6. *Optional*: Deploy or share your model, as desired

## Deliverables

By the end of this project, you will have produced three key deliverables:

- A clean and well-commented Jupyter notebook documenting your model for a technical audience.
- A written summary (or blog post) that explains your project for a non-technical audience.
- A presentation that describes your process for a general audience of both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
