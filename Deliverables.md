## Overview

Your final project is your opportunity to hone an independent data science problem, and use your skills from class (and beyond!) to produce a project that demonstrates your new skills.

The best final projects the use of data science to **solve a problem.** 

#### Pro Tips:
- Your problem does not necessarily need to be financially motivated in order to be be insightful. 
- Your goal should be to prove that you can use your new skills in a deliberate, thoughtful manner.
- You may wish to share this project with others, so try to:
    - Comment all of your code (this is also helpful as reminders for your future self)
    - Provide clear reasons and rationale for each decision

## Project Structure
The workflow for our final project is as follows:

1. Define a problem statement
2. Identify data sources
3. Clean and analyze your data
4. Build a model
5. Write up and present your findings
6. [Optional] Deploy, as desired

## Deliverables

You have three key deliverables:

- A cleaned Jupyter notebook documenting your process for a technical audience
- A written summary or blog post that explains your project's goals for a non-technical audience.
- A presentation for a general audience of technical and non-technical stakeholders. In other words, your presentation should balance descriptions of your process with rationale and purpose.
