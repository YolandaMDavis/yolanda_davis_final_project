> A presentation of 5–10 minutes, including time for questions.

### Overview

As a data scientist, you'll frequently be asked to present your findings to a mixed audience of both technical and non-technical stakeholders, so it's important to practice summarizing and breaking down your process for different levels of expertise. 

First, create a short summary of your problem and solution for a general audience. Keep it short and concise (i.e., one page). Think of this as an executive summary or — if you prefer — frame it as a blog post.

Second, create a presentation that reviews your project in more detail but still balances information for a general audience. Use visuals, explain your goals and approach, compare your results against initial metrics, and describe the impact of your findings. Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

> Optional: As a stretch challenge, try creating an interactive demo of your model in action!

## Requirements

1. Create a one-page summary write up (or blog post) that explains your project for a non-technical audience.
2. Create a detailed presentation (e.g., slide deck) that explains your model findings for a general audience (i.e., a mix of technical and non-technical stakeholders).
3. Your presentation should include:
   - A problem statement.
   - Initial metrics and assumptions.
   - Your approach and process.
   - A data model.
   - Your performance evaluation (compared to original success metrics).
   - The impact of your findings and any recommendations.
   - Suggestions for implementation or next steps.
 4. *Optional:* Create/host an interactive demo of your model, describe how you could validate your model's performance over time, or explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Consider what your audience values and needs to know.
- Don't just assume that your explanations make sense. Try testing your presentation on a sample audience ahead of time!
- Include more visuals (and less text) than you think.
- Don't just read your presentation — deliver it!

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will score each of the project requirements using the following scale:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

Feedback will be provided for each requirement.
