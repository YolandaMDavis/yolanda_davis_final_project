### Overview

This is it! You've made it to the finish line. Now that you've finished cleaning, modeling, and tuning your data, you'll need to present your results. Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science!

That's why for Part 5, you'll create a short presentation that delivers insights from your project to a general audience.

Create a presentation that reviews your approach and findings, addresses limitations or risks, and suggests next steps. Be prepared for questions!

**Goal:** A public presentation of your project, including an explanation of your problem solving process for general audiences.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Work backwards to consider what your audience values and needs to know
- Don't just assume that your explanations are clear - test your results on others and see what makes sense!
- Include more visuals (and less text) than you think.
- Don't just read your presentation - deliver it!
