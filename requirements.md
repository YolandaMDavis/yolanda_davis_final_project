## Final Project, Part 1: *Proposal*
   
> Frame your problem, criteria, and data source(s)

Describe your chosen problem and state whether you have access to relevant data.

### Requirements

1. Draft a well-formed problem statement.
2. Include the following elements:
   - Hypothesis/assumptions
   - Goals and success metrics
   - Risks or limitations
3. Identify at least one relevant internal dataset and show that you can load it into a Pandas dataframe.

If the project you propose at this stage does not work out, you can change course later on. However, you will have a much easier time if you invest time up front in developing a good problem statement.

### Format

Create a Jupyter notebook in a new Git repository. Describe your project with a few paragraphs of text in one or more Markdown cells, and load each dataset that you plan to use for your project into a Pandas dataframe. Push your repo to GitHub and follow the submission instructions in your course info document.

### Possible Projects

I usually see the best results on projects that are done for work, presumably because students can often develop them during work time and have strong incentives to do a good job. If a work-related project is not an option, you might choose a project related to a hobby or cause that you are passionate about. [Here are some sites you might explore for interesting data sets](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AdiBro/Resources/blob/master/Datasets.md).

We also provide a [list of curated datasets](./suggestions.md) that students have had success with in the past.

### Examples

See an example of a past submission [here](https://github.com/GraceCampbell/grace_campbell_final_project/blob/master/part_1_proposal.ipynb).

## Final Project, Part 2: *Brief*
> Perform EDA on your dataset

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in any data workflow. Create a Jupyter Notebook that explores your data mathematically and visually. Explore features, apply descriptive statistics, look at distributions, and determine how to handle sampling or any missing values.

### Requirements
1. Create an exploratory data analysis notebook.
2. Perform statistical analysis, along with any visualizations.
3. Determine how to handle sampling or missing values.
4. Clearly identify shortcomings, assumptions, and next steps.

<a name="notebook"></a>
## Final Project, Part 3: *Technical Notebook*
> Build and document a working model, prototype, recommendation, or solution.

Develop a prototype model or process to successfully resolve the business problem you've chosen. Document your work in a technical notebook that can be shared with your peers.

Build upon your earlier analysis, folling the performance metrics you established as part of your problem's evaluation criteria. Demonstrate your approach logically, including all relevant code and data. Polish your notebook for peer audiences by cleanly formatting sections, headers, and descriptions in markdown. Include comments in any code.

### Requirements
1. A detailed Jupyter Notebook with a summary of your analysis, approach, and evaluation metrics.
2. Clearly formatted structure with section headings and markdown descriptions.
3. Comments explaining your code.

> Note: Here are some things to consider in your notebook: sample size, correlations, feature importance, unexplained variance or outliers, variable selection, train/test comparison, and any relationships between your target and independent variables.

<a name="presentation"></a>
## Final Project, Part 4: *Presentation*
> Summarize and present your findings.

Present your findings to an audience that may include non-technical executive stakeholders. Summarize and break down your problem, approach, and recommendations in a manner that different levels of expertise will find informative and persuasive.

Create a presentation that walks through your goals, approach, results, and recommendations. Keep slides simple - no more than 2-3 pieces of information per slide. When in doubt, use visuals!

Finally, be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience.

> **Optional:** For a stretch challenge, try any of the following: creating an interactive demo of your model in action, explaining how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discussing how to evaluate your solution's performance over time.

### Requirements

1. Detailed presentation for non-technical audience.
2. Your presentation should include:
   - A problem statement.
   - Metrics and assumptions.
   - Approach and process.
   - Your model or solution.
   - Performance evaluation (how your approach compares to your original success metrics).
   - Impact of your findings.
   - Recommendations or next steps.

 4. *Optional:* Create/host an interactive demo of your model, explain how to deploy your model, or describe how you would evaluate performance over time.
 
Aim for **5-6 minutes**. There will be a **hard cutoff** at **7 minutes**. I want to reward preparing against these expectations, so these times **will not change** even if we have fewer presenters than we are anticipating at this point.
